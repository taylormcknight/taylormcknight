<p>Taylor McKnight is VP of Design at <a href="https://industrydive.com">Industry Dive</a>, a business journalism publisher with 26 publications, 12M readers and nearly $100M in annual revenue.<p>

<p>The 22 members of the design department that McKnight leads are spread across many time zones and divided into three teams: Product Design, Brand & Marketing Design, and studioID Design (content marketing).</p>

<p>In 2020, Industry Dive's design department was recognized as the publishing industry's <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/industry-dive-design-team-named-design-team-of-the-year-by-folio/">Design Team of the Year</a> by Folio.</p>

<h2>How I got here</h2>

<p>While studying international technology policy at The London School of Economics in 2012, I decided to jump from the social sciences to the startup world.<p>

<p>After completing my MSc in Global Politics, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, an 11-month-old business journalism publisher, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/startup/2018-02-05-startupjob.md %}"> employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of product design, graphic design, front-end web development, email development and more.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, I built and led a 22-member <a href="https://industrydive.design/">design department</a>.</p>

<h2>Designing my own life</h2>

<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">Life is short</a>. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is short</a>. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0ozXWfXQAEwFtB.jpg:large">Life is short</a>.</p>

<p>Given that reality, I try to design the life I want and help others do the same. Here is my personal blueprint:</p> 

<ul>	
	<li>Design a healthy life</li>
