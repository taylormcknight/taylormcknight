 <!--<p><strong>Problem 2: We – the media – often serve content as disconnected one-offs, storing them in link barns.</strong> Whether published on rag or via CMS, each story usually sets sail solo. When pubs and journalists fail to call out the connections, the reader never learns how different articles might be linked to each other in meaningful, meta ways.</p>-->

<!--
<p>This hurricane-like environment arises, in part, from how the media industry often delivers the news – one-off, bite-sized pieces of content. It is a method that produces far more boats of information than islands of understanding.</p>

<p>This problem is one Matt Thompson recognized and commented on as an RJI fellow. ...As Thompson, Rosen, and dozens of others have pointed out over the years, publications and journalists need to find ways to move the user from overwhelmingly turbulent to calm waters.</p>

<blockquote><p>"...the most important descriptions and explanations of journalism are lost when they are sliced into daily fragments, thin tissue cultures of reality, disconnected from a narrative framework. ...the reader can discover such descriptions and explanations only when the separate stories are reintegrated into a more coherent framework and when the episodes of the news have a narrative structure that contains elements of drama, nuances of character, and precise chronolical order."<citation class="citation"> – James Carey,<br> "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HX2B1vNRNEgC&lpg=PA144&ots=VQwmt49TUd&dq=The%20dark%20continent%20of%20American%20journalism%20carey&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=The%20dark%20continent%20of%20American%20journalism%20carey&f=false">The Dark Continent of American Journalism</a>"" 1986</p></citation></p></blockquote>

                        <p>There are a few common criticisms of "explanatory journalism" I believe reveal significant issues pubs have yet to fully address.</p>

                        <p><strong>Criticism: "Explanatory journalism" often involves claims to authority by people who are not necessarily experts.</strong></p>

                        <p>When a journalist writes an explanatory piece, she is asking the reader to trust <em>her</em> similarly to the way the reader trust's <em>external experts</em>. Of course, a lot of explanatory journalists don't start out with a huge knowledge base; they gain their expertise on the job. Jay Rosen has argued that this can actually be a good thing.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>"Jay points out in several places that it's okay and even desirable to have a non-expert reporter create explainers. When learning how to explain something, our initial ignorance helps us appreciate where our audiences are coming from. This approach still puts professionals in the role of sorting and presenting explanations."</p> <citation class="citation">Nathan Matias in <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/five-tech-ideas-for-explanatory-journalism">a 2012 post</a> on MIT Center for Media Innovation</citation></blockquote>

                        <p>Although these benefits likely exist, becoming an "expert" while claiming that same authority can also get journalists and their pubs in trouble. Make enough errors along the way, and you might end up a target – like Vox in <a href="http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/46-times-vox-totally-fucked-up-a-story-1673835447">this Deadspin piece.</a></p>

                        <p>Which brings us to the connected <strong>issue of trust</strong>. 

                        <p>Explaining the value of Vox, Ezra Klein points to the importance of trust in a user's decision to visit a particular site.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>If you get a rash, there is a page on Wikipedia about rashes. But you don’t go to that page. You go to the page on WebMD or the Mayo Clinic or whatever. That page is kept up by people who are experts in rashes. You go there because of the quality of writing and information and the organization standing behind it.</p><citation class="citation">– <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/ezra-klein-interview-vox-launch.html">Ezra Klein</a></citation></blockquote> 

                        <p>The crux of the issue is that Vox and other pubs that seek to "explain" the news need readers to trust them, to accept their claims to authoritative knowledge. This is the same issue that bloggers face. When readers lose trust, the authority of the source vanishes along with its page views.</p>

                        <p>Obviously, pubs need to tred with caution when they contradict conventional wisdom or defer to outside experts when they attempt to explain topics they do not deeply understand.</p>

                        <p>If resources are quite limited, as is the case with most pubs, another approach is to lay fewer claims to authority. Rather than assert you have expert knowledge on dozens of topics, focus on one or a handful.</p>

                        <h1>FIX THIS</h1>
                        <p><strong>Criticism: The explanatory approach is overused. We call too many pieces "explainers" or "explanatory journalism."</strong></p>

                        <p>It's a question one could pose about many media industry trends – like the spread of multi-media stories similar to NYT's "Snowfall." When <a href="https://t.co/8ZQJR25oD8">everyone is doing the same thing</a>, does the value dissipate a bit?</p>

                        <p>In the midst of this trendy chaos, the value of contextually-driven journalism that Thompson described — it’s ability to cut through the noise — erodes. What irony. “Explanatory journalism” has become another rising tide that drowns readers.</p>

                        <p>The same critique goes for “data journalism.”</p>

                        <center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember explanatory journalism, whatever that meant? So H12014. H2 is &quot;One-Chart/Map-To-Explain-Everything&quot; journalism.</p>&mdash; Rafat Ali (@rafat) <a href="https://twitter.com/rafat/status/535885755705720832">November 21, 2014</a></blockquote></center>

                        <center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who cares what the chart/map says, or if it is right way to tell the story? It brings clicks, so let&#39;s do lots.</p>&mdash; Rafat Ali (@rafat) <a href="https://twitter.com/rafat/status/535893425925935104">November 21, 2014</a></blockquote></center>

                        <p>In that second tweet, Rafat marked where the treasure lies. The value emerges when particular methods – e.g. explanations, charts, etc. – help you tell a particular story to a particular audience. When pubs heavily use labels like “explanatory” and hawk their “chart-based” or data-driven stories simply to drive engagement, they walk right by the X in the sand.</p>

                        <p><strong>Criticism – it's a catch 22 – too basic vs too complex</strong></p>

                        <blockquote><p>Sometimes I think in the media there can be a weird condescension toward the idea of providing people simple useful info they need in a simple format.We shouldn’t be laughing at the idea that Huffington Post managed to provide a service that people all over the internet needed provided. That’s something to learn from.</p></blockquote>
