                        <p class="fancy-quote first-quote">"People I think are growing restless with how difficult it is to understand news. In the old days, a newspaper was wonderful at helping you understand news. It was a package. It had a beginning, it had an end. You could read whatever you wanted of it, put it down and say, I feel like a pretty well-informed citizen today. But on the Internet, you can never say that. It keeps coming at you. The Twitter feeds and the email alerts. And you never feel like an informed citizen, you feel like an idiot. Because there is more and you can't handle it."<citation class="citation">– Jonathan Landman<br> Bloomberg QuickTakes Editor</citation></p>

                        <img src="context-islands/img/noun_263913.png" class="compass-rose" width="100" height="100">

                        <p><span class="first-letter">A</span> lot of journalists give little thought to jumping into the flow of a million news stories. Another day, another swim.</p>

                        <p>Non-media industry folk also dive into this sea; it just never feels like swimming. It's more like being dropped into the Atlantic just as a giant nor'easter absorbs Hurricane Gale.</p>

                        <p>The news is always so overwhelming. It's a wave so large, that no matter how strong your strokes, you can never quite reach the top.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps your first instinct is to blame the wide open waters of the web. There are just so many feeds, so many distracting GIFs.</p>

                        <p>"The Internet is causing a paradox of choice," you tweet. Oh how clever you are.</p>

                        <P>Of course, though on-the-nose, you are right. The older methods we have traditionally used to keep up with the events we care about are far more packaged experiences than Facebook or Twitter.</p>

                        <p>Such constraints serve to guide the reader through the turbulent stream of history. But be under no nostalgic illusion; when it comes to providing greater contextual understanding, physical papers suffer from some of the same problems as websites.</p>

                        <p>As the winner of the first Academy Award for Original Screenplay once observed, "Trying to determine what is going on in the world by reading newspapers is like trying to tell the time by watching the second hand of a clock."</p>

                        <p>It's true.</p>

                        <p>Whether we pick up a newspaper or dive into the forever feeds, it is pretty difficult to pause and zoom out.</p>

                        <p>But let's try, just for a moment.</p>

                        <p>There are at least two underlying issues here.</p>

                        <p>One problem pertains to the way we write the content. A second problem involves our content delivery methods.</p>

                        <p>To keep this post from becoming too unwieldly, I'm going to limit the scope to the former.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Recency – the core value of "news" – is not always accompanied by higher-level contextual insight.</p>
                        <p>The traditional approach to writing articles – <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2003/birth-of-the-inverted-pyramid-a-child-of-technology-commerce-and-history/12755/">the inverted pyramid</a> – does not help. It encourages journalists to focus on answering "What's the news?" while burying or excluding answers to the "whys" and "hows." Why is this story important? How does it fit into some larger context? Hell, the format makes it easy for the writer to forgo asking <em>herself</em> these questions.</p>

                        <p>Wait, you already know about this problem?</p>

                        <p>Okay, so the existence of this issue is not a great revelation to anyone.</p>

                        <p>But that's not the point of this piece. Far more novel and worth reading about are 1) the ways in which pubs have begun to infuse the "whys" and "hows" into their content and 2) how that transition came about within the media industry.</p> 

                        <p>Look around. Editorial practices and content delivery methods are changing. The inverted pyramid is getting hybridized and sometimes jettisoned all together. Explainers flow through the streets. Articles and other small units of content are even being roped together to form context islands.</p>

                        <p>That's right; those millions of eyes locked on every tick tock are now, every so often, glimpsing the ocean.</p>

                        <p>On June 22, 2015, a farmer from Fresno learned he got to keep his raisins. All of them, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf">said the Supreme Court</a>. Thus ended a lengthy legal battle between Martin Horne and the Department of Agriculture. The government could no longer require farmers to set aside a portion of their raisin crop each harvest, without compensation, to "help maintain stable [raisin] markets." It was a violation of the 5th amendment, ruled the Justices.</p><p>Although this was far from the top story of the week, journalists still <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-california-raisins-20150622-story.html">rushed to publish</a> coverage, to "break" the news. They later updated their posts, filling the empty ships with details, quotes, and other provisions to draw aboard more readers.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>A few miles west of the Court building, over on DC's North Capitol Street, one news team took a different approach. Like bloggers, they moved backward in time; they dove deep in their archives and surfaced a podcast from 2013 – "<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/06/24/417187957/episode-478-the-raisin-outlaw">The Raisin Outlaw</a>." It was all there – the key arguments, interviews with the major players, including Marvin Horne – the rich backstory of the case. Rather than record a completely new piece, the editors bookended the old audio with details about the recent ruling and published it. They were well aware that other pubs got the news out faster – the podcast was published two days after the Court's decision – but their story delivered a wealth of context.</p>

                        <p>A context-first approach to news reporting is core to what that team values. It is also how they – <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/">Planet Money</a> – got started; the program is the product of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>'s search for answers during the '08 financial crisis. Remember "<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money">The Giant Pile of Money</a>?" It is the kind of journalism that susses out the "why" and "how," not just the "who-what-when-where," of a story.</p>

                        <figure style="font-family:georgia;color:#666;">
                            <img src="context-islands/img/npr_bw.jpg">
                            <figcaption>NPR's office on North Capitol St NW <span style="color: #999;font-size: 12px;display: block;">Taylor McKnight</span></figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Two days after Planet Money released its updated "Raisin Outlaw" episode, a healthcare industry journalist sat glued to a TV in Living Social's first office, nestled above the Hooters in DC's Chinatown. The space is now home to <a href="http://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a bustling B2B media startup.</p>

                        <p>From the Rose Garden on the screen, <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?326785-2/president-obama-statement-supreme-court-health-care-decision">Obama delivered remarks</a> on the Court's King v. Burwell <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">ruling</a>, a decision that upheld key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). As Obama ended his speech amid the clicks and flashes of cameras unseen, Katie Bo Williams <a href="https://twitter.com/KatieBoWill?">@KatieBoWill</a> returned to her desk to draft the first of three stories.</p>

                        <p>The initial piece broke the news to her readers. It was a "<a href="http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-obamacare-subsidies-in-6-3-vote/401323/">Dive Brief</a>," a concisely formatted article that groups the who-what-when-where at the top of the page and key takeaways – "insights" – for executives below. Next, she provided additional context, writing a piece on <a href="http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/what-the-healthcare-industry-is-saying-about-king-v-burwell/401329/">reactions within the industry</a>. The following morning, Katie Bo published a longer analysis, chunking the information to help readers quickly get a feel for the broad effects the ruling already had and would likely have on the industry – "<a href="http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/4-huge-impacts-of-the-king-v-burwell-decision/401341/">4 huge impacts of the King v. Burwell decision</a>."</p>

                        <p>Not long after Katie Bo's listicle went live, The Supreme Court dropped another "<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/246255-obama-justice-arrives-like-a-thunderbolt">thunderbolt</a>" in Obergefell v. Hodges; they ruled that states must permit same-sex couples to wed.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>Two Red Line stops west of Industry Dive, over at <a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a>'s office,  German Lopez <a href="https://twitter.com/germanrlopez?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@germanrlopez</a> drew together explanatory materials to help the public – especially millennials – better understand the Court's decision. From links to the amicus briefs to a list of the cases SCOTUS consolidated into the new ruling, German incorporated a trove of contextual information in his <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8823655/gay-marriage-legal-scotus-obergefell-v-hodges">article</a>.</p> 

                        <p>Of course, German was not the only Vox journalist covering the event. Other team members repurposed these assets for use in <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8853037/freedom-to-marry-supreme-court">their own stories</a>.</p>

                        <p>More than windows into the world of contemporary journalism, these moments at NPR, Industry Dive, and Vox symbolize a growing trend. Publishers and their editors are making a strong effort to deliver more contextual information in new ways to readers. I wouldn’t call it a sea-change in coverage type, but you can feel the pull of a strong current.</p>

                        <p>Just scan the horizon.</p>

                        <p>The NYT has the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/upshot">Upshot</a>,” WaPo the "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/">Monkey Cage</a>," and Bloomberg the “<a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake">Quicktake</a>. The Economist publishes “<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains">The Economist Explains</a>” and Slate an “<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer.html">Explainer</a>” column. Then there are a whole host of pubs entirely dedicated to the "explanatory" endeavor: <a href="http://www.syriadeeply.org/">Syria Deeply</a>, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and <a href="https://decorrespondent.nl/en">De Correspondent</a>, just to name a few.</p>

                        <p>When and why did this shift toward greater context begin? And, given that context can provide readers safe and meaningful haven in the midst of hurricanes of information, how can pubs more effectively deliver it?</p>
                        <p>As someone who designs the UX and UI of news products, I want answers to these questions.</p><p>I also take seriously the advantages of reasoning "ab initio" – Latin for "from the beginning." Elon Musk often refers to this approach as reasoning "<a href="http://lifehacker.com/use-elon-musks-first-principles-method-for-better-br-1476303603">from first-principles</a>." To figure out the unknown unknowns and make strides beyond what already exists, we need to build our knowledge from the ground up.</p>
                        <p>And that is what we will do. We will travel to the beginning - a time not so long ago when the land of the "how" and "why" was so rarely visited, it was known as the "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HX2B1vNRNEgC&lpg=PA144&ots=VQwmt49TUd&dq=The%20dark%20continent%20of%20American%20journalism%20carey&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=The%20dark%20continent%20of%20American%20journalism%20carey&f=false">The Dark Continent of American Journalism</a>."</p>

                        <p>When did the media industry begin to systematically add context to the objective "facts" they reported? This is the first question I set out to answer.

                        <p>Of course, we can dredge the early web ad infinitum. There will always be a few treasures each time we raise the net. But this will never lead to understanding. For that, we need to climb the ladder to the crow's nest. We need to peer decades into the past and trace the evolution of objective news reporting toward greater contextual insight.</p>

                        <p>Out in the distance, do you see it? It is the long tail of the inverted-pyramid, a hard creature to spot. Researchers think it probably arose in our newsrooms sometime during the mid-to-late 19th century.<p>

                        <blockquote><p>Based on accumulated literature, origins of the objective news reporting may be placed somewhere between the rise of the penny papers in the 1830s and the post World War I 1920s, a span of nearly a century.</p><a href="https://ia802702.us.archive.org/1/items/ERIC_ED272873/ERIC_ED272873.pdf"><citation class="citation">Stensaas, 1986</citation></a></blockquote>

                        <p>Much clearer than its beginning is objective reporting's ascent to dominance.</p>

                        <p>In his 1986 study, "The Development of the Objectivity Ethic in Selected Daily Newspapers, 1865-1934," Harlan Stensaas looked at 360 news reports published by six daily newspapers over a seventy-year period. After selecting articles to code from three, 10-year blocks, this is what he found:</p>

                        <p><strong>1865–1874:</strong> Non-objective reporting was the standard – 40.8% of sampled news reports were "objective."</p>
                        <p><strong>1905-1914:</strong> Objective reporting began to take off – 65.8% of sampled news reports were "objective."</p>
                        <p><strong>1925–1934:</strong> Objective reporting became the new normal – 80% of sampled news reports were "objective."</p>

                        <p>As often happens with "standards" in the media industry, the objective approach to relaying the news was eventually displaced by something new. But when did this change occur? When was the beginning of the end for objective journalism? Was it Watergate ('72-74)? No, swing the spyglass to the left. There it is.</p>

                        <p>Although the inverted pyramid remained largely unchallenged until the 1960s, the media industry saw shadows of the creature it would evolve into as early as 1943.</p>
                        <p> At the request of the publisher of <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em>, Robert Hutchins, then president of the University of Chicago, formed "the Commission on Freedom of the Press."</p>
                        <p> The goal of the group was to study and better comprehend the value of media in a democracy. Four years later, Hutchins and his team published their findings. First and foremost, the report called on journalists to help readers make sense of the news.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Today our society needs, first, a truthful, comprehensive, and intelligent account of the day's events in a context which gives them meaning....  It is no longer enough to report the fact truthfully. It is now necessary to report the truth about the fact.</p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/freeandresponsib029216mbp#page/n5/mode/2up"><citation class="citation">Hutchins</citation></a></blockquote>

                        <p>The Commission envisioned a future in which the traditional role of journalists was greatly expanded. Rather than serving as "mere conduits for facts," journalists should, the team argued, "become involved at least to the extent of indicating what readers may do with the facts."</p>

                        <p>It was an explicit call for more context, for explanatory journalism. Of course, like most industries, the news media was slow to change.</p>

                        <p>Shift the spyglass to the right – toward the mid-1960s.</p>

                        <p>The style of mainstream news finally began to transition from a "who-what-when-where" approach to one more focused on answering the "whys" and "hows."</p>

                        <p>Empirical evidence of this progression appears in a <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/703/original/Fink-Schudson-ContextualJournalism.pdf">2013 study</a> in <a href="http://jou.sagepub.com/"><em>Journalism</em></a>.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Contextual reporting – a broader category that includes explanatory reporting but much more – barely turned up in our 1955 sample but by 2003 is close to half of what one finds on the front page of the three metropolitan daily newspapers we studied.</p><citation class="citation"><a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/703/original/Fink-Schudson-ContextualJournalism.pdf">Fink et al. (2013)</a></citation></blockquote> 

                        <p>The Columbia University team behind the paper coded 1900 news stories published by the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> (picked to represent America's "strong" regional newspapers) between 1950 and 2003. The results indicate a steady increase in contextual reporting over the years.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>You might think that classifying articles into these categories would be a bit difficult. According to the researchers, however, their system worked pretty well – "Of the nearly 1900 stories coded, the vast majority were easy calls."</p>

                        <p>What might have fueled the overall trend? Referencing other studies, the team at Columbia offer a host of likely influences:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase in investigative reporting</li>
                            <li>Increase in access to social science data and computers – helped journalists "consider the news value of what previously interested only social scientists"</li>
                            <li>Increase in professionalization of journalism, including number of well-educated journalists </li>
                            <li>Increase in complexity of society – public needed help understanding "the big picture"</li>
                        </ul>            

                        <p>The researchers also point to a <a href="http://www.academia.edu/3668300/The_Problem_of_Modern_Time_in_Journalism">2011 study</a> by Kevin Barnhurst of UIC that supports their findings.</p>
                        <p>Barnhurst's research revealed "consistent growth from 1914 through 2005 in the percentage of front-page stories that refer to either the past or the future...rather than to the temporally immediate context (hours or days) of the event the stories focus on."</p>
                        <p>When was the growth rate of front-page past/future references at its highest? Between 1994 and 2005 – the final year Barnhurst examined. Keep in mind, this was nearly a decade before the birth of sites like Vox and the rise of "explanatory journalism" as a Twitter buzzword.</p>

                        <p>In a <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/cornwall/en/hearings/exhibits/Mary_Lynn_Young/pdf/04_Barnhurst.pdf">related study</a> published in 1997, Barnhurst and Diana Mutz found that the number of news articles with references to the past doubled between the 1890s and 1990s. The researchers argued this was caused by a societal shift in how people perceive time. ...Whatever the origin may be, it is a sign that context was increasing in the news.</p>

                        <p>Of course, journalists haven't needed a wealth of academic evidence to feel the shifting tides.</p>

                        <center><hr class="fancy-quote-bars"></center>

                        <p class="fancy-quote">"'Episodic news' does not fit our time, or our technology."<span class="citation">– Elise Hu (<a href="https://twitter.com/elisewho">@elisewho</a>) in a <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/06/18/buzzfeed-news-app">2010 blog post</a></span></p>

                        <p>Jump to 2008. For several decades, journalists had recognized the value of and attempted to deliver more context with their reporting. The less restrictive medium of the web accelerated the process. It was against this backdrop that the financial crisis struck and unleashed a torrent of new, confusing concepts like credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities. The complexity of what had transpired left readers and experienced journalists, alike, utterly baffled.</p>

                        <p>Thus began a grand search for answers.</p> 

                        <p>In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/fashion/sundaystyles/12news.html?_r=0">2008 interview</a> with a reporter from The Times, NYU sociology professor Eric Klinenberg suggested that Americans had become "unusually transfixed by news of the day." The source of this urge, he argued, was the financial collapse, an ongoing event that found its way "into every corner of their lives."</p>

                        <p>Partly due to an industry-wide need to help readers – and journalists – understand the crisis, rich conversations about the very nature of news began to take place.</p>

                        <p>Journalists found themselves inspired to experiment with new approaches to context delivery. In May 2008, Alex Blumberg <a href="https://twitter.com/abexlumberg">@abexlumberg</a> and Adam Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/adamdavidson">@adamdavidson</a> released a special, long-form podcast for This American Life (TAL). It was an investigative and explanatory project on the housing crisis – "<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money">The Giant Pool of Money</a>."</p>

                        <p> Davidson and Blumberg later <a href="http://current.org/files/archive-site/news/news0909why-how-giantpool.shtml">revealed</a> to Karen Everhart <a href="https://twitter.com/keverhart">@KEverhart</a> of Current.org that their innovative style and approach was influenced by <em>Radio Lab</em>, a popular radio program that airs on WNYC. The hosts of the show – Robert Krulwich and Jad Abumrad – slowly unpack complex topics by bouncing questions and ideas off of each other.

                        <p>During the interview, Everhart pointed to specific moments in "The Giant Pool of Money" when the co-hosts cut in and said, "Stop the tape. That is a key piece of tape." Did Davidson and Blumberg strategically insert those lines to cue the reader? Yes, acknowledged Blumberg. It is a "<em>Radio Lab</em> trick," a way of pausing the narrative to deliver key context.</p>  

                        <p>Shortly after its release, this hour-long piece of audio went viral and became <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/04/giant_pool_of_money_named_to_d.html">the most-ever downloaded</a> TAL podcast episode. Jay Rosen <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@jayrosen_nyu</a> of NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute heard it and started to question why more news pubs don't deliver better context with their reporting.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Why are we serving people the news without the background narrative necessary to make sense of the news? I first became interested in this problem after listening to The Giant Pool of Money, the awesomely effective one-hour This American Life episode that finally explained to me what the mortgage banking crisis was, how it happened and why it implicated… well, just about everyone.</p> <citation class="citation"><a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2010/03/07/what_i_plan_to.html">Jay Rosen (2010)</a></citation></blockquote>

                        <p>Around the same time as TAL's podcast – early 2008 – a new pair of media industry thought leaders took the stage. They proposed compelling ideas about the problems and potential of contemporary journalism.</p>

                        <p>One of these two men was Joshua Benton <a href="https://twitter.com/jbenton">@jbenton</a>, a Nieman Fellow and former staff writer for The Dallas Morning News.</p>

                        <p>At the '08 Nieman Narrative Conference, Benton impressed veteran journalist and media critic Roy Peter Clark <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyPeterClark">@RoyPeterClark</a> of the Poynter Institute with a novel presentation about blogging as "natural journalism." Clark <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/writing/87714/from-blog-to-narrative-josh-benton-throws-us-a-curve/">reported</a> that he couldn't "remember learning so much in an hour" since he was presented with Donald Murray's "model of the writing process" 27 years earlier – in 1981.</p>

                        <p>Later that year, in October, Benton wrapped up his fellowship and <a href="http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2008/10/joshua-benton-directs-launch-of-nieman-journalism-lab/">launched</a> the Nieman Journalism Lab, a publication designed to "<a href="http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2008/05/benton-named-digital-journalism-editor-at-nieman-foundation-for-journalism-at-harvard/">highlight best practices in the [media] industry</a>" for journalists and academics. Among Benton's first two weeks of articles were posts on context delivery, including <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2008/10/quick-video-explainers-an-easy-way-to-tell-a-complicated-story/">a piece</a> on Marketplace's "quick video explainers."</p>

                        <p>As Benton began his new project, another media industry thought leader emerged into the spotlight – Matt Thompson <a href="https://twitter.com/mthomps">@mthomps</a>.</p>

                        <p>Even by 2008, Thompson was fairly well-known in media circles. This was largely due to his work at the Poynter Institute, including the creation of "<a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/">EPIC 2014</a>," a Flash video he and Robin Sloan <a href="https://twitter.com/robinsloa">@robinsloan</a> put together in 2004. The piece depicted one possible future for the media industry.</p>

                        <p>In 2008 and 2009, Thompson continued to explore the future of news as a Donald W. Reynolds Fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute (RJI). In his application – "<a href="ttp://www.rjionline.org/news/wikipedia-ing-news">Wikipedia-ing the news</a>" - Thompson described the value of connecting a body of journalism, rather than letting individual pieces disappear into a bottomless archive. He floated a project idea – a news site built like Wikipedia that links the story nodes together, placing them within rings and rings of overlapping context.</p>

                        <p>The proposal opened the door for Thompson to research and experiment with ways pubs could better deliver context with the news. As an RJI Fellow, he built a context-first site about the financial crisis (it no longer exists) and set up a conference in DC called "<a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/05/noodling-the-future-of-news-in-context/">The Future of Context</a>." I managed to track down <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mthomps00/rebuilding-media-the-future-of-context-2672438">the slide deck</a>, if you're interested.</p>

                        <p>Here is Thomspon in 2010 describing how pubs can deliver the type of contextual value inherent in Wikipedia.</p>

                        <p>In early 2009, as Thompson worked on his "context" research and Benton launched Nieman Lab, Marissa Mayer <a href="https://twitter.com/marissamayer">@marissamayer</a>, then at Google, painted a picture of "<a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2009/08/18/newbiznews-hyperpersonal-news-streams/">hyperpersonal news streams</a>" and journalism professors like Jeff Jarvis <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis">@jeffjarvis</a> started to talk about "<a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2008/09/30/the-building-block-of-journalism-is-no-longer-the-article/">what comes after the article</a>."</p>

                        <p>Fresh perspectives on journalism flooded the media industry.</p>
                      
                        <p>On March 15, 2010, Elise Hu <a href="https://twitter.com/elisewho">@elisewho</a> of NPR gave a name to what had been unfolding – “the context movement.” The big thought-shift, in Hu’s mind, was a departure from the old model of never-ending waves of one-off news stories to an approach that attempted to illuminate the wider sea.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Some great thinkers in media are leading what I’ll call the “context movement”, a push toward giving audiences more satisfying, better understanding of the worlds in which they live instead of simply presenting ephemeral, episodic stories as journalists always have.</p><citation class="citation"><a href="http://www.heyelise.com/tag/tristan-harris/">Elise Hu (2010)</a></citation></blockquote>

                        <p>Hu’s insights were largely sparked by an RJI panel conversation on “context” between Jay Rosen, Tristan Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/tristanharris">@tristanharris</a>, and Matt Thompson.</p>

                        <p>Hu posted a "cliff-notes" version of the discussion. I'll pull out five gems, but I highly recommend you <a href="http://www.heyelise.com/2010/03/15/contextualizing-context/">read her entire post</a>.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The single story approach is a problem.</strong> "Because journalism is structured around the single story, it’s not accommodating to help people have more meaning, more context.  But that’s a function of the old ecosystem."</li>
                            <li><strong>We don't measure understanding (but can we?).</strong> "Metrics on 'success' as organizations are also skewed because they measure how many people watched, how many clicked, not more understanding."</li>
                            <li><strong>Experienced journalists often forget the newbies.</strong> "...as reporters become experts, they begin to ID with most sophisticated users on their beats and then lose contact with people who are still starting out with a subject or entering late."</li>
                            <li><strong>A journalist knows the context of an issue but only gets to share tiny pieces at a time.</strong> "As reporters, we map out our beats, we actually understand issues systemically so we know what’s important. Then we dribble out all we know in stingy little bits (news stories)."</li>
                            <li><strong>If you aggregate valuable, evergreen content, readers will come.</strong> "The web also rewards news providers who provide context. People are far more likely to re-visit the wikipedia page or the topics overview a year after a news event."</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>2008-10 was a true journalistic renaissance,</strong> a period when we questioned our beliefs about traditional news models and became more self-reflexive. In the years that followed, the conversations <a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/blogs/slaffert/2011/06/lego-approach-storytelling">continued</a>, but the intensity was not quite the same.</p>

                        <p>As happens with most movements, the waves eventually receded, and we were left with the footprints in the sand. And what deep footprints they are.</p>

                        <p>From the current "explanatory journalism" trend to the appearance of more long-form, multi-media journalism, the marks of the "context movement" are embedded across the 2016 media industry landscape.</p>

                        <p>There is a running joke in the media industry that you need an explainer to explain "explanatory journalism."</p>

                        <p>Funny as it is, the joke is also true; the term leaves a lot to interpretation.</p>

                        <p><strong>The big question:</strong> How does "explanatory journalism" differ from other forms of journalism?</p>

                        <p>When I dove into this problem, one of the first explanations I encountered was this line by Johnny McDermott <a href="https://twitter.com/mcdermott">@mcdermott</a>, <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/explainer-rise-explanatory-journalism/">published on Digiday</a>:</p>

                        <p>"Explanatory journalism is a form of reporting that attempts to present nuanced, ongoing news stories in a more accessible manner."</p>

                        <p>Makes sense. But, isn’t that simply describing a difference in degree (quality), rather than kind? How is “explanatory” a separate category of journalism?</p>

                        <p>If you’re confused, don’t be alarmed. Even journalists don’t get it.</p>

                        <p>Some journalists are confused, because they have always been providing context on the war with Eastasia. To them, providing context is considered the unquestionable best practice. Rewind to the days – pre 60s – when the news pyramid was much more inverted, and the distinction makes far more sense.</p>

                        <p>However, if contemporary journalists are accustomed to posing and answering the "hows" and "whys" in their articles, this means at least parts of the industry have been marching in that direction for years.<p><!-- recently started to call some sites and columns the "explanatory" label while withholding it from others? Isn't it all the same ol', same ol' under the sun?</p>-->

                        <p>Roy Peter Clark certainly seems to think so...</p>

                        <blockquote><p>So now I’m the old guy, and I get to say things like “there’s nothing new about explanatory journalism,” and, even better, “Ezra, it’s called the inverted pyramid, not the reverse pyramid, and some of us have been trying to knock it down for a long, long time."</p>
                        <citation class="citation">– <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/writing/244285/a-new-explanatory-journalism-can-be-built-on-a-strong-foundation/">Roy Clark</a></citation></blockquote> 
                        <p>Looking to the comments on Clark's article, there's an insightful <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/writing/244285/a-new-explanatory-journalism-can-be-built-on-a-strong-foundation/#comment-1299360066">exchange</a> that provides a more in-depth perspective.</p>

                        <p>The commenter – Jay Rosen – offers his own explanation of "explanatory journalism." He argues that "practical revisions in rules that were never fully articulated in the first place will result in a new format that cannot be explained."</p>
                        <p> This description helps us understand why there is so much ambiguity surrounding the term – the shift from one implicit standard – the "who-what-when-where" approach – to one more focused on "how-why" – is hard to articulate.</p>

                        <p>In Rosen's view, the underlying story goes something like this: For years, pubs sought ways to control their staff through the mechanism of strictly objective writing. Later on, the pubs realized they were producing "lots of news, but not what it means." Within this conceptual framework, "explanatory journalism" is simply an offshoot of a larger trend – "relaxations in a newswriting discipline that was designed to minimize the risk of being wrong." The result is that journalists are now largely free to "explain" the news.</p>

                        <p>As NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik has pointed out, the long-term repercussions of this transition on newsroom politics were significant.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>What I think you're really seeing is a pivot; with the balance of power going from these major, famous, you know, world-renowned news organizations to many of the journalists who have really driven online digital traffic for them.</p><citation class="citation">David Folkenflik, NPR media correspondent in an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/01/03/259432745/explanatory-verticals-give-give-big-name-journalists-more-power">interview</a> with All Things Considered host Audie Cornish in January, 2014</citation></blockquote>

                        <p>In a nut graph: The contemporary "explanatory journalism" movement – Vox, NYT's TheUpshot, Bloomberg's QuickTakes, etc. – are natural extensions of the rise of context in news that has been ongoing for decades. Perhaps the "context movement" of 2008-10 sped up the growth a bit – it certainly made "explanatory journalism" a much more common term – but the arc was already bending in that direction.</p>

                        <p>So, is there anything truly new and meaningful we can say about <em>current</em> forms of explanatory journalism? If we're talking about the classification of individual articles, perhaps not. If we are talking about approaches to journalism, I believe we can.</p>

                        <p>For the first time, pubs across the media industry have begun to invest huge amounts of resources – money and people – in explanatory approaches that are explicitly labeled as such – from cards to columns. In doing so, the industry has begun to systematize and institutionalize the philosophy. A growing number of journalists are now trained to focus on explanation and, to an extent, are assessed on how well they deliver on the insights; this is certainly true at Industry Dive.</p>

                        <p>It's also clear that now, more than ever, pubs recognize that an explanatory frame of reference can guide their staff throughout the content creation process. When the approach is institutionalized, journalists begin to think context-first – e.g. "How can I explain this news event so my readers derive the most value?"</p>

                        <p>I know this effect exists, because I have seen it first-hand. During a conversation about delivering context, one of our editors told me he constantly thinks about "Vox's approach" when he writes his stories. "Sometimes, I kind of feel like I'm a teacher preparing for a class. How can I best explain this? It inspires me to better know the material." </p>

                        <p>All of this has led me to believe that it is as important to view “explanatory journalism” as a heuristic as it is a label. <strong>It is as much a way to encourage as describe the type of journalism we have all come to value – content that increases reader understanding, not just knowledge.</strong></p>

                        <p>The unique value of a modern explanatory project does not lie in its format – expository – but its ability to make journalists think context-first. When journalists think this way, they are empowered and motivated to draw on large corpuses of knowledge, past and present, and weave them together, illuminating the context that begets reader understanding.</p>

                        <p>Do all explanatory projects do a great job at this all the time? No. Sometimes articles published by a "regular" pub provide more context on an issue than those of a self-described “explanatory” pub. The key differentiator? Often, it is the individual journalist. Ultimately, it is at that level where the burden lies.</p>
