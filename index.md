<h2>Bio</h2>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/about/headshot-2022.jpg" class="headshot">
<p>Over the last 10 years, I've led design at Industry Dive, a bootstrapped business media company in Washington, D.C.</p> 

<p>I helped scale the company from year one through its $500M exit in Sept 2022.</p>

<p>I've built and led a variety of creative and technical teams: product design, brand marketing, content marketing design, news data and graphics, and front-end development.</p>

<h2>My story</h2>

<p>While studying the impact of the internet on society at the London School of Economics, I was inspired to jump from the social sciences to the startup world. After completing my MSc in Global Politics, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, an 11-month-old business media company, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/startup/2018-02-05-startupjob.md %}"> employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of design and front-end development.</p>

<p>From 2012 to the present, I built out a twenty-two member multi-disciplinary and global <a href="https://industrydive.design/">design department</a>, helping scale the company to 12M+ readers, $100M+ in revenue and 400+ full-time employees.<p>
<p>Over those 10 years, I have been responsible for the following areas of work: UX design, UI design, front-end design/development, editorial graphics, photo journalism and graphic design. I also co-led product management with C-suite for the first 5-6 years.</p>-->


<h2>Designing my own life</h2>

<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">Life is short</a>. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is short</a>. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0ozXWfXQAEwFtB.jpg:large">Life is short</a>.</p>

<p>Given that reality, I try to design the life I want and help others do the same. Here is my personal blueprint:</p>
