The positive physiological effects of meditative breathingÂ â€“Â e.g. reduced cortisol levels, a slower heart rate, etc. â€“ are well-documented (<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-link">1</a>, <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-link">2</a>, <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-link">3</a>). We are even beginning to unravel the mechanisms underlying the relationship between breathing and higher-order brain function <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-link">(4)</a>.

Notably, many people who engage in a form of meditative breathing do so while participating in a separate action â€“Â e.g. yoga, freediving, etc. Committing to a breathing exercise as a standalone activity is much more difficult.

Given this reality, how can we help more people perform meditative breathing at home on a consistent basis?

According to the "Fogg Behavior Model," motivation, ability and a prompt have to properly align at a specific moment for a behavior to take place.

In the case of meditative breathing at home, sufficient motivation and a prompt are the missing factors.

To address these issues, I built a novel preventive care device.

### Increasing motivation

I started off by thinking about how to make the land-based version of my freedive breathe up more enjoyable and relaxing. Can I bring the natural marine environment into the home?

Recently, I had contemplated using bioluminescent dinoflagellates to build a biolamp to reduce the negative health impact of traditional artificial lights and increase wellbeing.

I wondered if there was a way to integrate the glow-in-the-dark plankton with a breathe up.

What if the user conducts the breathe up as a nightly ritual? The user can exhale into an aquarium tube that ends in a container of bioluminescent dinoflagellates. The plankton would light up due to the movement of the water.

It sounded plausible! And cool!

### The build

It turns out that it is pretty easy to obtain bioluminescent dinoflagellates. All I needed were $30 and a week of time for the shipping. I also ordered enough nutrients to keep them alive for a few months.

The design of the holding container included a boiling flask and a small tripod with a flexible arm and a clamp.

To keep the liquid dinos from spilling out, I used a stopper in the flask and drilled a hole for the air tubing.

I also cut the tubing in half and added a one-way air valve to prevent a siphon from forming and the water flowing out of the container.

### Results

The bioluminescence of the dinos when agitated was fainter than I expected, but still awesome to witness. Unfortunately, it was difficult to capture the tiny light show on camera. Below is a 30 second exposure of the boiling flask with the dinos as the only source of light in the room.

The first week of tests produced results that were more intriguing than I anticipated. Not only did I feel more relaxed after the breathing exercises and desire to do them more often, I noticed that the plankton influenced my behavior in ways I did not unexpect. Because the plankton was a living organism, I found myself focusing on their wellbeing, too. To help them maintain their natural circadian rhythm, I started turning off the artificial lights in my room earlier in the evening than I otherwise would have. This, in turn, led me to fall asleep sooner and helped address some temporary insomnia I had been experiencing.

### Introducing a prompt

As a prompt, I decided to have the dinos text the user at a designated time every night to confirm that the daily breathe up was completed.

I remembered a discussion at work about a service called Twilio. We had considered using it to send breaking news alerts via SMS to our readers.

After checking out Twilio's documentation and pricing, I signed up for an account and set up the following flow logic:

* User receives SMS from Twilio: "Hey, buddy. Did you do your breathe up tonight? Text me 1 when you're finished and 2 if you just need a night off."
* User texts back "1": "Awesome! Rest well, buddy. ðŸ’¦"
* User texts back "2": "No worries. Another time. Rest well, buddy. ðŸ’¦"

Note: "Buddy" is a gender-neutral term used by divers to refer to their diving partner.

Next, I tested out the user experience on my phone by running a version of the command below in terminal on my laptop.

<code>curl -X POST "https://studio.twilio.com/v1/Flows/BFb9e42s354def1aknA0ekfDF0f5y53@/Executions" -d "To=+13333333333" -d "From=+12222222222" -u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN</code>

Below are texts I exchanged with my Twilio account.

<!--I also decided to borrow a page from the <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/snapstreaks">Snapchat playbook</a> and create the "Dinostreak."

The number next to the ðŸ’¦ tells you how many days you've done a breathe up.-->

### Increasing user focus

During my dinoflagellate-based lamp research, I had discovered that the plankton produce their strongest bioluminescence when disturbed "with turbulence stimuli at a single speed."

This was perfect. I could encourage the user to focus on the quality of the breathing technique by pointing out that the best bioluminescence could only be achieved via a slow and steady exhale.

### Plans for future testing

In the near future, I hope to test the device with more people.

**Blood pressure and heart rate**

I will measure the ability of the device to lower blood pressure and heart rate, recording the relevant data before and after the breathe up with wifi-enabled monitors.

**Sleeping patterns**

I will measure the ability of the device to improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia by recording and analyzing user sleep patterns with a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/sleep-better">Fitbit</a> or similar wearable.
