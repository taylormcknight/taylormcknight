What is imperfect about the article format?

Don't think about aesethetics.

Think about an article as a unit of info. A newspaper is a unit that holds smaller, related units. What are the problems, the limitations of, the article? Think about this from the perspective of the reader. Think about digital articles, especially.

A couple months ago, I posed this same question to a friend. What is wrong with the article format?

Below is a screenshot of part of our exchange.

The article is imperfect, because it usually does not provide you with broad context. One way to address this limitation is to improve the way we link articles together. We can improve the packaging.

What might this look like?

Imagine if every article was assigned to higher-level units based on recency, topic, etc. ...Wait, we already do that – we tag articles and they appear in higher-level sections like topic pages.

That is true. But the articles on topic pages are fairly loosely connected. We need to fine-tune the packaging a bit. 

What if a user reads an article about a particular merger and wants to learn more about what led to it? Or what if a user reads a news story about a new attack in Syria and desires to get up-to-date on the overall conflict? Most publications don't make it easy for the reader to achieve these goals. Instead, the reader must leave the publication website and conduct a global web search to try and find explanatory articles for background.

Publishers could address this reader desire for greater context by grouping related articles into one-stop-shop storylines loaded with context.

Any given article could be included in an unlimited number of storylines.

Imagine if news publishers arranged content this way.

Editors could package as many or few articles as they wanted and call the storylines whatever they wanted – e.g. The Pepco-Exelon merger, the Syrian conflict, etc.

The storylines would help guide the reader through higher-level trends, topics, periods of time, etc.

No more endless feeds of one-off, disconnected stories.
