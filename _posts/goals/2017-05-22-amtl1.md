description: Following my Everest and Kilimanjaro treks, I had a strong desire to summit more technical peaks. Living in Washington, D.C., I had access to the Appalachian range – good for trail running, camping and a little rock climbing – but not mountaineering. For that training, I turned west and headed to the Cascades.
