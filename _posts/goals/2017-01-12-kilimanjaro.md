description: This is a case study of my successful Kilimanjaro summit ascent via the Machame route in January 2017. When I landed at Kilimanjaro airport in Tanzania, I had neither booked the climb nor a room for my first night. This was what I wanted – an unstructured, off-the-grid experience that would sharpen my ability to improvise and allow me to more meaningfully engage with the people I encountered.
