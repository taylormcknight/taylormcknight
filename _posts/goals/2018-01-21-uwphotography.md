description: After I earned my Open Water and Advanced diving certs, I set a goal of visiting two of the world's top diving locations within the next year. First up was the Gal√°pagos. I contacted one of my buddies from film school and planned a two week trip over the 2017-18 New Year's holiday. With film and photography backgrounds, we both desired to visually document our dives. This meant I needed to learn underwater photography and purchase or rent the necessary equipment.
