description: Diving in the Galápagos quickly became one of my top goals after completing PADI Open Water and Advanced certifications over Labor Day weekend in 2017. Just before the New Year's holiday, my friend Joe and I headed south to explore the islands and document the marine life. Based on our experiences, I prepared a guide to help make the trip logistics a little less daunting for others.
