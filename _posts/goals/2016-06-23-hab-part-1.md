## I. Background

When I was 19, I committed myself to eventually launching a commercial space company. How that decision came about is a post for another time, but that underlying factor is the motivation for this project. My long-term obsession with space naturally bleeds over into my spare time.

At the age of 20, I read about a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/09/the-150-space-camera-mit-students-beat-nasa-on-beer-money-budget/">group of MIT students</a> who were able to get images of the blackness of space and curvature of the earth by launching a high-altitude weather balloon (HAB) into the stratosphere. It was hard to believe how relatively inexpensive the project was – under $1000. No need to wait for commercial space tourism. No need to compete to become an astronaut. All that was required was the research, a few friends, time, and $500-700 worth of gear.

I knew I had to try this one day.

Three years later, after I wrapped up grad school and started a new job in DC, I began planning.

It wasn't until I was 27, however, that the launch actually took place.

Why did it take so long?

- **During my first couple of years in DC, I worked many nights and weekends to help grow a startup** from five employees to 60+ while teaching myself graphic, front-end, and UX design. This left little time for serious side projects. I didn't even take a vacation until well into my third year on the job (not recommended).

- **I wanted to do my due diligence.** From studying the FAA regs to learning about mistakes made by other HAB teams, I wanted to do all I could to prevent injuring a person or property. I also didn't want my project on the news or to find myself in trouble with the law.

- **The weather was often uncooperative.** Even on clear days, the direction and intensity of the wind often led to poor flight path predictions – e.g. the expected flight path traveled over airports, major cities, or an extremely long distance.

## II. Project overview

The goal was pretty straight-forward – launch a high-altitude balloon to record footage of the earth from the stratosphere and then recover the payload.

For this first build, I decided not to include a flight computer or do any high-altitude science experiments. The basics – a successful launch and recovery – were my priorities.

The rest of this post covers my build process and how I selected the launch site. A <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/goals/2016-06-24-hab-part-2.md %}">second post</a> details the actual launch and recovery.  
## III. Research phase

Over the past three years, I devoured hundreds of blog articles and and YouTube videos related to high-altitude ballooning.

There's actually a lot of great material out there...

Like tales of balloons <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/skycademy-balloons-everywhere/">lost at sea</a>.
How-to guides for building <a href="http://www.daveakerman.com/?page_id=338">SMS tracking</a> systems.
And, of course, loads of cool videos...

## IV. Build phase

After doing some preliminary research, I kicked off the build process by focusing on how not to harm anyone or break the law.

Seemed like the right thing to do.

### IV.I FAA regulations

The FAA regs are actually pretty straight-forward and easy to meet.

<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=14:2.0.1.3.15#se14.2.101_11">PART 101—MOORED BALLOONS, KITES, AMATEUR ROCKETS AND UNMANNED FREE BALLOONS</a>

<ul>
	<li>Payload must be under 6lbs</li>
	<li>Break strength of rope must be < 50lbs</li>
	<li>If the balloon is up for more than 2hrs, you must alert the FAA. This is called a "floater."</li>
</ul>

Since I'm based in DC, I also had to travel 100 miles to get out of restricted airspace.

To make it clear that I followed the letter of the law, I printed out the regs and taped them on the side of the payload.

### IV.II Payload components

**Harris Teeter cooler**

Pretty standard $10 cooler. Easy to cut holes in and then seal against water.

**SPOT GEN 3 GPS Tracker**

The GPS was obviously one of the most important parts of the payload – second only to the launch vehicle (cooler). It also tied the GoPro for most expensive part. $150 for the Spot + $150/year for the online tracking service.

To ensure a clear and consistent GPS signal, I had to fashion a crude gimbal-like contraption out of photo frame wire. This ensured that the Spot always pointed toward the sky, no matter which way the payload rotated.

**GoPro Hero 4 Black**

I bought the GoPro refurbished online, but I still felt conflicted about launching such an expensive device without guarantee of recovery. Not a millionaire yet.

### IV.III Lift system

**Balloon**

Based on my research, I went with the Aether Industries 600g 20 ft diameter professional weather balloon.

To figure out how much helium I needed, I used the recommendations and reference table on the <a href="http://www.aetherandbeyond.com/main/education/balloon-inflation.html">Aether site</a>: "<em>It is recommended to have a total lift weight of 2 lb. (1 kg) plus the total weight of the payload in order to control the ascent speed.</em>"

**Parachute**

After debating whether or not I wanted to create my own, I ended up just purchasing a 5ft chute from <a href="http://www.the-rocketman.com/chutes.html">Rocketman</a>.

**Kite string**

Connecting the Balloon to the parachute and the payload is the tether. To achieve the FAA's required < 50lb break strength, I decided to use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/feet-Winding-Nylon-String-Spool/dp/B003DHTT8Q">kite string</a>.

**Latex Gloves**

The oil from your skin can actually cause the balloon at a lower-than-desired altitude. To avoid this issue, our team wore <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dynarex-Safe-Touch-Powder-Free-Gloves-Medium/dp/B0007LDJ7S">latex gloves</a> when handling the balloon.

**Cable ties**

To securely close the mouth of the balloon, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-6235-Assorted-Cable-200-Piece/dp/B000NQ16NG">cable ties</a>.

## V. Launch criteria and flight simulation

Picking a launch site wasn't easy. The site had to meet some pretty strict criteria:

- 100 miles outside of DC
- Within a day's drive to/from my apartment
- Not close to any airports or urban areas
- Positioned such that the wind would not carry the balloon toward any airport, major urban area, or large body of water – e.g. Chesapeake Bay or Atlantic Ocean.

Thankfully, there are some great free tools available to help with this step.

**Tool #1: Google Maps.** 

I first used Google Maps to scout out potential launch sites outside the 100 mile radius and ensure no airports were nearby.

**Tool #2: Flight simulator.**

After finding a possible launch location using Google Maps, I plugged the coordinates, along with some other key data, into a <a href="http://predict.habhub.org/">HAB flight simulator</a> to see where the balloon might end up. This step was critical. A couple of scenarios with strong winds had the balloon ending up in downtown DC, downtown Baltimore, and near a military facility.

The final flight plan avoided all of these obstacles.
