**Role:** Design director

Leveraging my undergrad training in film and video production, I helped the Industry Dive editorial and Brand Studio teams establish in-house podcast production capabilities.


## The initial ask

In 2017, the editorial team decided to experiment with a new journalism format - the podcast.

Given my prior training in film and video production, I was brought into the project for technical advice.

Realizing that this was simply an experiment, I offered to loan the Editorial department my personal <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H4N-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder/dp/B01DPOXS8I">Zoom H4N recorder</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-LAVALIER-Condenser-Microphone-Omni/dp/B003Z8OUUA">Rhode lav mic</a>.

## Hardware

After several months of podcast production with my loaner equipment, the journalists approached me about potentially acquiring higher-quality gear. I drafted a list of hardware recommendations. 

After receiving purchasing approval from company leadership, I ordered the following:

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/">Rode NT-USB USB Condenser Microphone</a>
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016YKNI26/">Audio-Technica ATH-M30x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones</a>
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHQW6JU/">Rode Microphones SC6 Dual TRRS input and Headphone Output for Smartphones</a>
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EO4A7L0/">2 of Rode smartLav+ Lavalier Microphone for iPhone and Smartphones</a>
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012OFI25I/">LyxPro VRI-10 Portable Adjustable Sound Absorbing Vocal Recording Panel</a>
* 27" iMac
	
## Software

Following the hardware purchase, I set up Adobe accounts for our editors so they could use Adobe Audition for sound editing on the new iMac.

I also set up a dedicated multi-media project directory on Dropbox for the editors to easily back up and remotely access project files.

## Product design and development

After the podcast production with the new equipment was in full swing, we set up a <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/topic/podcasts/">dedicated page</a> on our publication sites for users to easily browse episodes. To reduce navigation friction and improve the overall podcast listening experience, my team also designed and helped implement a custom Soundcloud API integration. This allows users to play the podcasts without leaving our site.
