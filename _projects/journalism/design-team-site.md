**Role:** Design director

When the Industry Dive design team grew from two to five, I started to look for ways to showcase our best work and attract high quality talent. 

One way in which I sought to achieve this was through the creation of a Jekyll-based blog hosted with Github Pages. Not only has this project helped us with team recruiting, the development and maintenance of the site has been a favorite project of the front-end designers on the team.
